# Blood Bank Management System

# Description:
The Blood Bank Management System is a command-line-based application designed to streamline the administrative and record-keeping tasks of a Blood Bank facility. This project allows blood bank staff to manage various aspects of their operations efficiently, including hospitals, blood donors, patients, blood stock, and staff records.

# Key Features:

1. Blood Bank Management: Within the system, administrators can oversee vital aspects of blood banking, including blood bank location, blood bank name, and available blood group management. This ensures precise organization and monitoring of blood resources.

2. Hospital List Management: Easily add, view, and delete hospital records, including the hospital name, location, and hospital ID. All data is stored in a dedicated text file for reference and easy retrieval.

3. Blood Donor List Management: Maintain a comprehensive list of blood donors, recording essential information such as donor name, registration number, donor ID, and blood group. The data is stored in a separate text file for future access.

4. Patient List Management: Keep track of patients and their blood-related information, including their name, the amount of blood required, and blood group. Patient records are stored in a dedicated text file.

5. Blood Stock Management: Manage the inventory of available blood stock. Track the amount of blood, donor ID, and the type of blood in stock. Records are maintained in a text file for easy monitoring and control.

6. Staff Management: Efficiently manage hospital staff records, including staff name, staff ID, and the services they provide. All staff records are saved in a separate text file.

The project ensures that all data is saved in text files, making it easy to preserve records, retrieve information, and continue management seamlessly across sessions. This Blood Bank Management System streamlines and enhances the administrative processes within a Blood Bank institution, ultimately contributing to better blood resource management.
